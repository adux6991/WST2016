<p>According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4263509/why-are-frames-deprecated-in-html">an answer in Stackoverflow</a>, the main reasons why &lt;frameset&gt; is obsolete in HTML5 might be as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Frames prevent users from properly bookmarking pages. When a bookmarked frameset page is loaded, users' previous mouse clicks inside the frames do not matter. Only the outer URL is saved, and users have to navigate to where they were manually.</li>
<li>Frames present challenges for printing web pages. Printing all the frames at once is not suited to the different dimensions of paper (and users can get only the first pageful that way). Users generally have to right-click the frame they want and choose the appropriate context menu option.</li>
<li>Users coming from search engines may not have access to navigational elements if they are located in another frame â€” they are directed to only that frame the search engine found the text in.</li>
</ol>
