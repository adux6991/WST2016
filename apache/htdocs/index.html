		<p><a href = "/django/polls/main/">Click to show answer</a></p>
		<p> I choose Python Django Framework. </p>
		<p> First of all, I have to install Django without <code>sudo</code>. I find <code>pip install --user</code> extremely useful and succeed after a lot of effort.</p>
		<p> Second, in order to deploy Django in Apache, I manually build mod_wsgi.so and load this module in httpd.conf. Thus when Apache detects <code>/django</code> in URL, Django will be called to handle it. Since the built-in web server in Django is too weak to be deployed in production environment, I am not able to use Reverse Proxy or Load Balance.</p>
		<p> At last, the most important part is coding. Django is a MVC framework, but the names are different:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Model:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;models.py           </li>
			<li> View:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;templates/xxx.html  </li>
			<li> Controller: urls.py & views.py  </li>
		</ul>
		<p> Here is what every file does: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>models.py:</b> define a class <code> Guest </code> with four attributes <code>(name, age, gender, email)</code> and interact with database automatically.</li>
			<li> <b>urls.py:</b>   associate URL with functions in views.py. For example, when the URL <code>/django/polls/query/</code> comes, the function <code>query</code> in views.py is called.</li>
			<li> <b>views.py:</b>  control the database and send results to templates. For example, the function <code>query</code> fetches all <code>Guest</code> entries from the database and send them to templates/query.html. </li>
			<li> <strong>templates:</strong> define how data is presented, act as View in MVC. </li>

	<h3>Homework 3</h3>

	</form>

	<h3>Homework 4</h3>
	<p>Write a brief essay outlining the differences between AWT and Swing graphics.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit) is a Java interface to native system GUI code present in your OS. It will not work the same on every system, although it tries. </li>
		<li>Swing is a more-or-less pure-Java GUI. It uses AWT to create an operating system window and then paints pictures of buttons, labels, text, checkboxes, etc., into that window and responds to all of your mouse-clicks, key entries, etc., deciding for itself what to do instead of letting the operating system handle it. Thus Swing is 100% portable and is the same across platforms (although it is skinnable and has a "pluggable look and feel" that can make it look more or less like how the native windows and widgets would look). </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Homework 5</h3>
	<p>For additional credit: use threads to implement some sort of animation ... try moving the shapes around.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>What are JavaScript browser sniffers?</li>
			<p>JavaScript browser sniffers are techniques written in Javascript in order to determine the web browser a visitor is using, and to serve browser-appropriate content to the visitor.</p>

			<li>Why are they so commonly used in javascripts?</li>
			<p>Because Javascript relies heavily on DOM, whose interpretation varies in different browsers. To circumvent incompatibilities between browsers and ensure consistent display of content, browser sniffers are used. </p>

        Use CSS and DIV.

        Your performance of designing the layout will be evaluated in Firefox 3.5.
        However, you are encouraged to test your layout in as many browsers as possible.
        You will receive a bonus if you design layout that has the same appearance in IE6, IE7+, Opera, Safari, etc.
        and mention this effort in your homework. Remember Maxthon, Sogou and Tencent Traveler
        are not considered as individual browsers, for they are only shell of IE.
        Also, try to pass both <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">the W3C Markup Validation</a>
        and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">the W3C CSS Validation</a>, then place

            Study the &quot;Survey&quot; example in the text book carefully. <a href="conelec.html">Try it first</a>.
        <br />
            Implement a little &quot;Questionare&quot; using Perl.
          Information to be collected include:
            <ul><li>Name.</li><li>Age.</li><li>Gender.</li><li>E_mail address.</li></ul>
          <p>In addition to the Submit button, a Query button is provided for the user
            to see all data items have been collected. User should also be able to delete
            selected Items. </p>
          <p>Tips:
          <ul>
          <li>Three CGI program are needed, one to collect data items, one to
          list items, the other to delete selected items.</li><li>To delete items, for convenience, a check
          box could be provide to each data item being listed. After user click "delete", all checked items are deleted.</li>
          <li>Error check for the input data is not required.</li>
         <li>To prevent simultaneous accesses to a single file, "flock" function is used. please refer to the Survey
         example in the text book.</li>
          <li>In order to be run, the CGI program file should has a file mode of 711, which says it can be executed by any user.</li>
          <li>Put the CGI program in the directory of &quot;cgi-bin&quot; under you Server
            root Directory.</li>
          <li>The file which saves the collected data should be created first and should be writable for other users. A file mode 666 is needed.</li>
          <li>The error.log file in the directory of &quot;logs&quot; will help you to
            debug your CGI program in case of error.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You are encouraged to improve this questionaire in some way. For example,
                you could use AJAX to update the information without refreshing the page,
                write three versions of this questionaire in Perl, C CGI and Shell CGI,
                or make pages produced by CGI pass W3C validations.
                Any efforts made should be listed in your pages as they deserve a reward.
