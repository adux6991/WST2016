<p><strong>Homework1: For the three categories of web software technology we've just defined, you are asked to find out which category so-called "Netscape plug-in" technology belongs to. Please describe the basic idea of the technology, and give your reasoning on its position in the technology categories.</strong></p>

<p>Netscape plug-in belongs to the third category "Distributed Object Technology".</p>

<p>Netscapr plug-in is referred to as NPAPI(Netscape Plug-in Application Programming Interface). In NPAPI architecture, a plugin declares content types (e.g. "audio/mp3") it can handle. When the browser encounters a content type it cannot handle natively, it loads the appropriate plugin, sets aside space within the browser context for the plugin to render and then streams data to it. The plugin is responsible for rendering the data. The plugin runs in-place within the page, as opposed to older browsers that had to launch an external application to handle unknown content types.</p>

<p>Like ActiveX, NPAPI offers in-page extensibility and allows browsers to deal with different objects, whether it's remote or local. So it's part of distributed object technology, instead of basic web protocol suite or productivity and quality-oriented technology.</p>

<p><strong>Homework2: In a normal intercommunication between Web browser and Web Server, Web Server closes the network communication right after it sends back the document requested by the browser. Think about this statusless character of World Wide Web. Give some good points and bad points of it. Can a web server know exactly how many browsers are reading its document?</strong></p>

<p>Good:</p>
<ol>
<li>It simplifies the server design. Because there is no need to dynamically allocate storage to deal with conversations in progress. If a client session dies in mid-transaction, no part of the system needs to be responsible for cleaning up the present state of the server.
</li>
<li>It saves resources of the server. TCP ports and memory space of the connection are no longer needed once the content is sent back.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bad:</p>
<ol>
<li>It may be necessary to include additional information in every request, and this extra information will need to be interpreted by the server.</li>
<li>Cookies are needed to track the user state, number of connections, last connection, etc.</li>
</ol>

Recommended search engines are <a href="http://www.baidu.com/">http://www.baidu.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a></strong></p>
